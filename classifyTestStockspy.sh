# Attempts to classify data based on which bars will
# go up by 1` before they drop by 1`.  With the assumption
# that greater than 50% accuracy could be profitable 
# depending on trading fees.   Those that go up are 
# classified as 1 those that drop are classified as 0
# The classification step is done by stock-prep-sma.py 
# which also splits the data between train and test file.
#
# To Run the Stock example on SPY data first run the 
# the utility to download data from yahoo python yahoo-stock-download.py
# then run utility to convert raw stock data into machine learning
#  data python stock-prep-sma.py then  you can run
# this module.

# -optMaxTime=19   Number of seconds the optimer is allowed to run
#
# -doOpt=true      Allows optimizer to run 
#
# -optClassId=1    Tells optimizer to focus on improving results for class 1%
#                  predicts stock will go up 1` before it drops by 1`
# 
# -OptMaxPrec=0.53 Tells optimizer to focus in improving Recall once 
#                  precision exceeds 53%.  It will still accept changes
#                  to improve accuracy but it will also accept changes 
#                  that improve recall provided it does not reduce 
#                  accuracy below 53%.

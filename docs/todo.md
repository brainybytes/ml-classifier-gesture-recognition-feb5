#Future Work List#
**Please coment and critique.**  I need your help to ensure future work is prioritized to help the people actually  using the library.  http://BayesAnalytic.com/contact

##Focus Areas##
There are several focus areas where I can invest time. Please let me know if you have an opinion for prioritizing between them. 

* **Implement the optimizer / discovery aspect.**  I explain some of this in the [Genomic research white paper](genomic-notes.md) The optimizer allows the engine to take a large set of features and determine which features are more import for accurate prediction.  Which features hurt prediction.  How different features should be grouped into different sized quanta buckets.
* **Implement the optimizer / discovery aspect.**     In a Healthcare scenario the optimizer not only improves the prediction quality but it could help researchers to discover that Age is less important than they thought while Bits 1,13,27 in chromosone Y are very important for predicting Condition X when bit 1 and 13 are turned on but bit 27 is turned off.
* **Implement the Quantized Filter Algorithm in GO** This version more closely approximates the multi-layer approach used in CNN in TensorFlow but with a drastically different approach.  It can provide better output when there is a benefit from eliminating matching on a class when there is a negative match for a given feature such that there is no matching quanta from the test set.  This could allow us to do even a better job of important discovery and can provide better capacity on eliminate featurs that negatively contribute to prediction accuracy. 
* **Finish the HTTP wrappers to allow it to run as REST service.**   This could be helpful to allow the classification engine to be integrated with a VR engine running on a different piece of hardware or written in a different language. This could be important when analyzing data sets with lots of classes because the data sizes could become larger than could be contained in mobile devices. 
* **Implement Time Sequence recognition** Some gestures must start with a given pose that transitions between a series of poses ending in a termal pose. Recognizing these moving gesture recognition may be acomplished by classifying several input sets across time then running as a set through a second classifier.  Since all humans will not move at the same rate one interesting aspect will be allowing for variable time between the poses. 
* **Implement the text parsing version**.   Many common demonstration systems use text databases like IMDB and attempt to classify input text against those movies.  This is interesting but has a lot of overlap with search engines.  See [Text classification overview](docs/text-classification/overview-classification.md)
* **Implement the image parsing version** so we can test against ImageNet and Minst.   Much of the TensorFlow work is demonstrated parsing and classifying images. I didn't not invent the quantized classifier for engines but it would be interesting to see how it performs. 
* **Optimize for Image Classification**   I am not sure this is worth while because image classification is one area where CNN and other Deep learning seem to perform very well with relatively little tuning. 


##Roughly prioritized Feature Work##

* DONE:JOE:2017-01-30: Enhance QuantProb classifier so when classifying a given column we use the largest number of buckets possible then fall back for that column to a lesser number when we get a miss on the number of buckets.  This means we need to create the index for 2 to N buckets which means we need to add one more layer to the model builder.   This should allow us to use the most specific value match we can with reasonable fallback. 

* DONE:JOE:2017-01-30: Fix the Breast Cancer demo that is currently reporting 75% accuracy.  The Bucket # seems to be messed up.  In a column with a value range from 1..10 and numBuck=10 it is assigning value 2 to bucket 92. 

* Add by class reporting to tensorflow script results.

* If we want to use Optimizer for data importance discovery then we should consider tracking weights by bucket ID rather than the feature level.  That way if we boost  the weight of a given bucket it gives us a direct signal on the value of that data element.   

* Add a simple analysis component that shows the predictive value of each single feature.  eg: run the classifier for a single feature varying numBuck for that feature.

* Add simple analysis component that shows predictive value of different groups of features compared to other groupings of features.   

* Add a analysis component that analyzes predictive value of each feature column.    It should be able to measure the value for total precision of the set or for a combined input on predictive value by class.   It should seek to find a number of buckets for that feature that will maximize predictive value from that feature and be storable so the set of these values can be used to configure operation of the primary classifier.     

* Add analysis component that randomly combines feature combinations in twin and tripplets to see if we can find sets that provide good predictive value superior using features individually.   This should probably be done using the quant filter combination so each mini set is working as a mini decision tree.

* Add Ability to include mini-feature sets groups of fields in the quant prob model.   This could either be done by the primary quant prob engine or possibly by an external component that essentially create the feature groups and takes the statistical output from them to build a new file which is fed into the quant prob engine.  This approach would help isolate complexity but may be slower.   For example  if we find that day of week + hour of day + % above Min represents a good feature group using the quant_filter aspect then comming out of that engine we know the relative probability by class.   May be able to combine this into a single feature using a range for each class but it may be easier to create a new column one for each class  that contains the probability the quant_filter found for that feature group for that class.  Then we could suppress the actual features in the input set.  In the short term the easiest way to run this would be to generate an intermediate file but if it works well should be done as virtually added columns. 

* Create ClassifyAnal module to create output Statistics

  * Output should include Add recall, precision by class in classifyFiles
  * Convert output of run from byte array to a structure that can be retained and used as output by optimizer to compare quality of output against other runs. 
  * Add report of base prob by class so we can see how the Accuracy of the class compares to the base probability or measure Lift.

* Implement Model Save and Model Restore for Classify.go Saves the model wide parameters in INI file key=value Saves the model wide parameters in INI file key=value / parameters in file fiName.model.txt  Saves the feature defenitions in CSV format. featureNum, NumBuck, FeatWeight, TotCnt, Bucket1Id, Bucket1Cnt, Buck1EffMinVal, Buc1MaxVal, Bucket1AbsMinVAl, Bucket1AbsMaxVal Where each of the Bucket1  features are repeated for 1..N buckets.  This should give us everything we need to restore a model with  all of it's optimized settings intack.  It also gives us a nice representation to support the discovery aspects of the system.  function saveModel

* Implement LoadModel to restore model state from files created by saveModel.  Also add print model that produces human friendly version. 

* Implement browser display utility to display in nice format data from saveModel

* Add a function which reports by Class and for the entire set What is the minimum Prob Number needed to reach a given level of precision in 5% increments from the base sucess  rate to 100% success rate.    This should include the % of recall at each tier. This may be a alternative way to set the optimizer goal where we seek to maximize recall at the X% such as 95% precision. 

* Split the work for training and classification out to multiple cores.   May as well read X lines in chunks and allow each one to process the input.   Will be easy for classification but may require synchronizing the models for training to avoid two threads updating the same buckets simutaneously but could still have one core doing the load and split,  another core doing the convert to float and a 3rd core doing the document update.   Could also possibly have each core build their own model and merge the counts at the end which would scale better for a distributed architecture.     Another approach would be to switch the trainer so it is feature centric so they share a input set of rows but each process / core is only updating one feature which would remove the risk of overlapping count updates.  Also write a document on how this is approached for the Bayes blog. 

* Add QProb optimizer that is allowed to change Feature weight and number of buckets.

This will allow much faster re-train when changing the number number of buckets in the optimizer.    Also Requires Modify the classifier core to accept row with array of flow.  Separate the parsing / conversion form the training.

  > * weight and feature number of buckets seeking to maximize precision at 100% recall. Where total number of buckets is considered primary cost.  Minimum number of buckets is equal to 2.  a Feature can be turned off by setting it's feature weight to 0. 
  > * Optimizer needs ability to reserve some data from training data set to use for training.  It needs to periodically change which data is reserved.  EG: It may choose every 5th record for a while then switch to every 10th record.   It Also needs choice to use only last x% of set for optimizer setting when running with time series data.
  > * Optimizer rules.   Can keep change if precision increases while recall stays the same.  Can keep the change is recall rises while precision remains the same. Can keep change is both precision and recall rise.   Can keep change if precision rises but recall doesn't drop below a configured threashold.    When changing number of buckets must always try  1 bucket,  1/2 current number of buckets,  random number between 1 and max buckets.   When changing  priority of a feature it must first try a priority of 0,  then a priority of 1/2 current priority, then random number between 0  and maxPriority.   When changing features the system must ensure all features are checked so first try 3 random features then 1 feature from each end working from the end towards the other end.

* Write  a blog on bayes for approaching text classification.  Based on [Text classification overview](docs/text-classification/overview-classification.md) 

* Add ability in CSV Files for command line parser to specify a column other than column #1 as the class.  

> - Only include detail probs if requested.   
> - Choose column to use as class

* Normalize Output Probs so the sum of all classes  in any prediction for a given class is 1.0 
  But need to make sure this doesn't mess up confidence  of prediction between multiple lines.  May need to   take an approach of dividing by the number of columns  that could have contributed rather than those that  actually contributed then when we scale up it would 
  provide more accurate output.  The We are currently  apply the count for only the features that have a matching  bucket to be more accuate we need to apply feature weight
  to the divisor even if we didn't get a match for the feature  for that class.


* Update CSV Parser to automatically build a class ID for CSV columns that contain string values.   The first time it sees each value assign it a integer value from the series.    Will need to save those values to allow reverse mapping.   Also need to support this for the class columns.


* Update rest of filenames links in readme.md to link to local source for the same file. 
* Modify the BAT files to skip Erase and Build when SKIPGOBUILD Env Var is set.
* Add Shell script alternatives for each of BAT file. 
* Produce GO version of the Quant Filter to see if we can improve performance on the diabetes and titanic data set.  The Quant filter is unlikely to deliver 100% recall since it aborts the match as it traverses the features when it fails to find a matching bucket id. This gives it some precision filtering capability similar to the multi-layer convoluted NN but at a lower cost.  We may be able to add probability since it is still computed by class by feaure. There some chance that more than one class will survive all layers of the filter which would mean we need to add a probability to that output to act as a tie-breaker. 
  - Add optimizer to quant filter that allows it to  vary the number of buckets by feature.  Seting number of buckets to 1 essentially turns a feature off by forcing all items into the same bucket. The primary cost function is total number of buckets. The goal of optimizer is based on starting with all buckets equal to X.  As it varies the number of buckets
    by feature it can keep the change provided it can  increase precision as long as recall does not decrease. Or it can increase recall as long as precision does not decrease recall.  We can discourage over learning by always trying a smaller number of buckets first in the optimizer.  A natural side effect of this is that the engine can turn off
    features that do not contribute either accuracy or recall.
    get. 
  - The weakness of the current QuantFilt strategy is that it tries to find the most restrictive quant able to make a match but when it fails it moves to the next least restrictive set of quanta for the entire matching process.  What we really want is for it to back track only for the feature where the most restrictive match did not work reduce the restriction only for that feature and keep the more restrictive requirement for the others.   This is complex because overly restrictive setting at any feature can cause failure in all subsequent features the the back track has to work it's way back incrementally.  


*   Modify Quant_prob run as server handler. 

*   Method will use main as data set name unless &dset is specified.
    * Each named data set is unique and will not conflict with others.
    * Method to add to training data set with POST BODY
    * Method to add to training data set with URI to fetch.
      * Allow the system to skip every N records to reserve for 
      * testing.
    * Method to classify values in file at URI 
      * Allow &testEvery=X to only test every Nth
        item.  This is to support testing.     
    * Method to classify with POST multiple lines.
    * Method to classify with GET for single set of features.
    * Allow number of buckets to be set by column name
    * allow column name to be set map direct to bucket id

*   Implement the samples with [AWS MXNet](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/seamlessly-scale-predictions-with-aws-lambda-and-mxnet/) libraries for comparison. 

*   Produce a version for text parsing that computes position  indexed position of all words where each unique word gets  a column number.   Then when building quantized tree               lookup of the indexed position for that word  treat the word  index as the bucketId or possibly as columnNumber need to think  that one through buck as a bucket id seems to make most sense and then treat all the other features as empty. So the list of cols may grow to several million but will only contain the hashed classes for those value. Allow system to pass in a list   of columns n the CSV to index as text.  This would not effectively use word ordering but we could use quantized buckets for probability of any word being that text in text string so            a word like "the" that may occur 50 times would occur in a different bucket when it is repeated many times. 

*   Finish filling in sections of the [Genomic research white paper](genomic-notes.md). Add Test set for Daily stock bar data.  Where we add a column which is a SMA(x) where X defaults to 30 days. and features are the slope of the SMA(X) when comparing current bar to SMA(x) at some number of days in past create.  In a stock scenario  you would have a goal EG: A Bar for a symbol where price rose by P% within N days without dropping by more than Q% before it reached P%.  Those that meet the rule get a class of 1 while those that fail get a class of 0.

* DONE:2017-01-20 Test the classifier against Image data to see how it performs.  State of the art seems to be a 16% error rate. Will need a way to incrementally update the engine image by image rather than reading all the data from a CSV.  Try it first just by converting the images native.   Then reduce the images to greyscale and try again just to see how it does.  Will need to buy a larger hard disk.   http://image-net.org/download-imageurls  http://image-net.org/  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet  At the very least this set of images would be great to test a image search engine.    I suspect we will need to analyze the image in smaller blocks and then classify them individually.    The best strategy would likely be to attempt to trace similar colored objects after applying an averaging filter then classify based on the vectors. http://farm1.static.flickr.com/32/50803710_8cd339faaf.jpg  As shown here differentiating the background from primary object and accomodating different scale of primary object along with different postion will be the most challenging.  

>>> I tested it with data for mnist and I cifar-10 with mnist best quantizer score for cifar was  31% compared to 36% for the Tensorflow CNN.   With mnist digit classification the best score for quantizer  was 51% while the CNN scored over 91%.    It is a little surprising the Qauntizer did as well as it did on the cifar data since it has no support for subjects moving within the frame of the data.   It could be improved but image classificaiton doesn't seem like a good place to invest with the excelent work already being done in that area.    A surprising aspect is that when n_epoch was low between 5 and 8 the CNN speed improved to be nearly comparable to the speed of the Quantized classifier.   I did find the n_epoch needed to be about 150 to get good precision out of CNN on these data sets and then it was 5 to 10 times slower.

# Convert a stock bar file into a tagged stock 
# data more interesting for machine learning.
# The rule will be that the price from a given Bar
# measured as day open must rise by X% before it 
# drops by Y%.  If it does then that bar is classified
# as 1.  Those that fall by more than X% are classified
# as a 0.  
#
# Four our indicators we are going to use a series of
# SMA and compute the slope of the line from the SMA
# for current bar to sma at some bars in the past.
